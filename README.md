# clojure-encog

Clojure wrapper for the encog (v3) machine-learning framework .

-from the official encog website:
---------------------------------
"Encog is an open source Machine Learning framework for both Java and DotNet. Encog is primarily focused on neural networks and bot programming. It allows you to  create many common neural network forms, such as feedforward perceptrons, self organizing maps, Adaline, bidirectional associative memory, Elman, Jordan and Hopfield networks and offers a variety of training schemes."

-from me:
---------
Encog has been around for almost 5 years hence, can be considered fairly mature and optimised. Apart from neural-nets version 3 introduced SVM and Bayesian classification. With this library which is a thin wrapper around encog, you can construct and train many types of neural nets in less than 10 lines of pure clojure code. The whole idea from the start, was to expose the user as less as possible to the Java side of things, thus eliminating any potential sharp edges of a rather big librabry like encog. Hopefully I've done a good job...feel free to try it out and more importantly, feel free to drop any comments/opinions/advice/critique etc etc...

ps: This is still work in progress. Nonethelessthe neural nets and training methods are pretty much complete - what's left at this point is data-models, randomization and the bayesian stuff...aaaa also I'm pretty sure we need tests :) ...
